# Introduction
For this assignment, we are following along with Unity's "Real-time Animation Storytelling" course. The course is split into seven units, with the addition of a final project, as well as "creative challenges" at the end of each unit.


# Summary


# 1st Deliverable
### Unit 1: Getting Started
For Unit 1, we downloaded and set up the Unity Hub and the Unity Editor. After creating an ID and signing in, we created our first 3D project.

### Unit 2: Real-time Previsualization
In this unit, we learned about previsualization in Unity through modeling based on a reference sketch. We created a few buildings with Primitive objects, and then downloaded and installed Probuilder. After learning some of Probuilder's tools, we created Materials for our city and adjusted the lighting.  

For the first Creative Challenge, I wanted to experiment more with Probuilder and make a larger city. I wanted to combine a sci-fi/post-apocalyptic look with something more traditional, so I chose Japanese architecture.

### Unit 3: Environment, Modeling, and Set Dressing
In Unit 3, we learned to assemble an environment using assets provided by the course. We also created our own props, using Probuilder. Lastly, we added ambient lighting and edited the pre-existing material emissions, to manipulate the "feeling" of the scene.

In the Creative Challenge, we had to use the provided props and make some new ones, to set-dress a different area of the Scene. I made two vending machines (a blue one and a red one) and a toll for the cars.

### Unit 4: Animation
In this unit, we learned the basics of animating in Unity using Timeline. We animated props (like vehicles and security cameras), as well as Generic and Humanoid characters. Lastly, we installed the Recorder Package and rendered our animations to mp4 video.

For the Creative Challenge, our objective was to create a short animation with at least two characters and two props. I chose two Humanoid characters and the cat, as well as two vehicles and a security camera. I also added some lights and other props to the scene, and adjusted the directional light. The story behind my short animation is a girl chasing her cat who run away from home and is exploring the city.

### Unit 5: Cinematography
In Unit 5 we learned more extensively how to use Unity's Main Camera, in combination with Cinemachine, in order to create multi-camera shots. After following the tutorial to get a grasp of the technique, I created my own cameras and shots. I blended some together, and for other I tried adding some visual effects.

### Unit 6: Adding Visual Fidelity Through Lighting
In Unit 6, we learned about lighting and post-processing. After, again, following the tutorial, I made changes to the lights in my scene, added new ones, as well as animated them with activation tracks.

### Unit 7: Effects and Final Render
In this final Unit, we learned how to create particle effects and edit them with the VFX Graph. We also learned how to add sound to our scene. Following the example of the tutorial, I created my own particle effects. One in the alley and one in the street. Lastly, I added my own sound effects, which are meant to represent the sounds of the city. I made sure to adjust their volume, so that they are not too loud.
